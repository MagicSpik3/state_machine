OK, I've never coded in SPSS before. I will talk about some of my pre-conceptions. Correct anything that is wrong. Also explain in more detail what I talk about. Making a State Machine from an SPSS pipeline is likely easier than for, say Python or R. It is a much simpler language and (aside from syntactical discrepancies) is smaller and more well defined. In R we have one library possibly overwriting a method from base with a new method via a loaded language. In Python, we have decorator classes that may completely change (although probably shouldn't) the flow of a function. Also, we don't have classes, objects of the complexities of OOP, hence everything is sequential. If we can iterate through the workflow with sufficient patience and care, we should be able to untangle it, no matter how complex. There is likely a tree (from one point, splitting to many possible outcomes) for a flow diagram, whereas in Python or R we can have a far more complex structure. The main enemy we are trying to defeat is years of unknown updates to the process and a lack of documentation or human knowledge of the true functionality.
